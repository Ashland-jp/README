# Hi, I’m Austin! 👋

    I’m a carpenter. I enjoy learning hacking, programming, and building odd electronics. 
    Lifelong skateboarder as well as drift car builder/fabricator. 
    I enjoy combining my natural technical skills with my diverse(ADHD) interests to create cool things 
        whether its houses, cars, tech toys, and now software and security.(maybe DevOPs is a good move for me?) 
    I have no real skin in the game. I just do this because I love it and I can't help but keep learning more. 
                    
                            
    
## **🚀 About Me**

    🌱 I’m currently focusing on programming and networking. I'm also playing with local llm's, MCP server creation and implementation.
       We're in the 'throw shit at the wall and see what sticks' phase. 
    🔧 I genuinely enjoy building small electronics projects and retrofitting small-board computers into random objects
    ♻️ I’m an avid upcycler (hoarder of interesting things), always on the lookout for new materials and tools to repurpose.

A small electronics project where I setup a Raspberry Pi 3b+ for WarDriving, capturing WiFi networks and analyzing their security.

### Random Object Retrofits
