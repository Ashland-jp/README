# Hi, I’m Austin! 👋

    I’m a passionate carpenter who loves ethical hacking and building odd electronics projects. 
    I'm also a lifelong skateboarder as well as non-professional drift car builder/fabricator. 
    I enjoy combining my technical skills with my diverse interests to create unique and innovative solutions.
## **🚀 About Me**

    🌱 Proficient with Linux. I’m currently diving into cybersecurity fundamentals with a current focus on web application security
    through platforms like TryHackMe, and HackTheBox. I have completed courses like Google’s Foundations of Cybersecurity
    and a few begninner learning paths on TryHackMe. I’ve also explored programming with Python, JavaScript, SQL, Bash, and Solidity.
    🔧 I’m passionate about building small electronics projects, such as my RaspberryPi3b+ WarDriving rig, and retrofitting small-board computers into random objects.
    ♻️ I’m a passionate upcycler (hoarder of interesting things), always on the lookout for new materials and tools to repurpose.
